## Roadmap

Todo:

* Add constraints (no double semester project, etc)
- Save feature
- Offer offline HTML page of study plans
* Implement an automatic conflict resolver
* Take minors into account(?) -> would build the path for other masters
* Choose which master to look at, alternatively specify the link of the study plans
