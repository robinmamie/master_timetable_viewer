# Master Timetable Viewer

The Master Timetable Viewer allows EPFL Master students to build their timetable interactively.
It displays all necessary informations (timetable, credits, etc.)

Currently only available for the Computer Science EPFL Master.

## Roadmap

Todo:

* Specify the specializations
* Allow the user to choose the semester (currently set to `m1_2019.pdf`)
* Count all credits selected
* Allow change between semester while saving credits & timetables
* Choose which Master to look at, alternatively specify the link of the study plans
