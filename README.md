# Master Timetable Viewer

The Master Timetable Viewer allows EPFL Master students to build their timetable interactively.
It displays all necessary informations (timetable, credits, etc.)

Currently only available for the computer science EPFL master.

To launch the program, please type the following in a terminal:

    python app.py

## Roadmap

Todo:

* Allow the user to choose the semester (currently set to `m1_2019.pdf`)
* Allow change between semester while saving credits & timetables
* Take minors into account(?) -> would build the path for other masters
* Choose which master to look at, alternatively specify the link of the study plans
